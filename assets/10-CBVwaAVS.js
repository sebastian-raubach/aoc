const e="Today, the Elves are playing a game called [look-and-say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence). They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example, `211` is read as \"one two, two ones\", which becomes `1221` (`1` `2`, `2` `1`s).\n\nLook-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the next step. For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like `111`) with the number of digits (`3`) followed by the digit itself (`1`).\n\nFor example:\n\n- `1` becomes `11` (`1` copy of digit `1`).\n- `11` becomes `21` (`2` copies of digit `1`).\n- `21` becomes `1211` (one `2` followed by one `1`).\n- `1211` becomes `111221` (one `1`, one `2`, and two `1`s).\n- `111221` becomes `312211` (three `1`s, two `2`s, and one `1`).\n\nStarting with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process 40 times. What is **the length of the result**?\n\n[comment]: <> (PART 2)\n\nNeat, right? You might also enjoy hearing [John Conway talking about this sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA) (that's **Conway of Conway's Game of Life** fame).\n\nNow, starting again with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process **50** times. What is **the length of the new result**?\n\n";export{e as default};
