const e="The incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on your submarine. The submarine has [polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization) equipment that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.\n\nThe submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it offers a **polymer template** and a list of **pair insertion** rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nNNCB\n\nCH -> B\nHH -> N\nCB -> H\nNH -> C\nHB -> C\nHC -> B\nHN -> C\nNN -> C\nBH -> H\nNC -> B\nNB -> B\nBN -> B\nBB -> N\nBC -> B\nCC -> N\nCN -> C\n```\n\nThe first line is the **polymer template** - this is the starting point of the process.\n\nThe following section defines the **pair insertion** rules. A rule like `AB -> C` means that when elements `A` and `B` are immediately adjacent, element `C` should be inserted between them. These insertions all happen simultaneously.\n\nSo, starting with the polymer template `NNCB`, the first step simultaneously considers all three pairs:\n\n- The first pair (`NN`) matches the rule `NN -> C`, so element `C` is inserted between the first `N` and the second `N`.\n- The second pair (`NC`) matches the rule `NC -> B`, so element `B` is inserted between the `N` and the `C`.\n- The third pair (`CB`) matches the rule `CB -> H`, so element `H` is inserted between the `C` and the `B`.\n\nNote that these pairs overlap: the second element of one pair is the first element of the next pair. Also, because all pairs are considered simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered to be part of a pair until the next step.\n\nAfter the first step of this process, the polymer becomes `N`**`C`**`N`**`B`**`C`**`H`**`B`.\n\nHere are the results of a few steps using the above rules:\n\n```\nTemplate:     NNCB\nAfter step 1: NCNBCHB\nAfter step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB\nAfter step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB\nAfter step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB\n```\n\nThis polymer grows quickly. After step 5, it has length 97; After step 10, it has length 3073. After step 10, `B` occurs 1749 times, `C` occurs 298 times, `H` occurs 161 times, and `N` occurs 865 times; taking the quantity of the most common element (`B`, 1749) and subtracting the quantity of the least common element (`H`, 161) produces `1749 - 161 =` **`1588`**.\n\nApply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. **What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?**\n\n[comment]: <> (PART 2)\n\nThe resulting polymer isn't nearly strong enough to reinforce the submarine. You'll need to run more steps of the pair insertion process; a total of **40 steps** should do it.\n\nIn the above example, the most common element is `B` (occurring `2192039569602` times) and the least common element is `H` (occurring `3849876073` times); subtracting these produces **`2188189693529`**.\n\nApply **40** steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. **What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?**";export{e as default};
