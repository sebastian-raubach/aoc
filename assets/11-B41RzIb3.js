const e="You hear some loud beeping coming from a hatch in the floor of the factory, so you decide to check it out. Inside, you find several large electrical conduits and a ladder.\n\nClimbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the beeping: a large, toroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves here are hurriedly running between the reactor and a nearby server rack, apparently trying to fix something.\n\nOne of the Elves notices you and rushes over. \"It's a good thing you're here! We just installed a new **server rack**, but we aren't having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!\" You glance around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\naaa: you hhh\nyou: bbb ccc\nbbb: ddd eee\nccc: ddd eee fff\nddd: ggg\neee: out\nfff: out\nggg: out\nhhh: ccc fff iii\niii: out\n```\n\nEach line gives the name of a device followed by a list of the devices to which its outputs are attached. So, `bbb: ddd eee` means that device `bbb` has two outputs, one leading to device `ddd` and the other leading to device `eee`.\n\nThe Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn't due to any specific device, but rather that the issue is triggered by data following some specific **path** through the devices. Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't flow backwards.\n\nAfter dividing up the work, the Elves would like you to focus on the devices starting with the one next to you (an Elf hastily attaches a label which just says **you**) and ending with the main output to the reactor (which is the device with the label **out**).\n\nTo help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need you to find **every** path from `you` to `out`.\n\nIn this example, these are all of the paths from `you` to `out`:\n\n- Data could take the connection from `you` to `bbb`, then from `bbb` to `ddd`, then from `ddd` to `ggg`, then from `ggg` to `out`.\n- Data could take the connection to `bbb`, then to `eee`, then to `out`.\n- Data could go to `ccc`, then `ddd`, then `ggg`, then `out`.\n- Data could go to `ccc`, then `eee`, then `out`.\n- Data could go to `ccc`, then `fff`, then `out`.\n\nIn total, there are **`5`** different paths leading from `you` to `out`.\n\n**How many different paths lead from `you` to `out`?**\n\n[comment]: <> (PART 2)\n\nThanks in part to your analysis, the Elves have figured out a little bit about the issue. They now know that the problematic data path passes through both `dac` (a [digital-to-analog converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter)) and `fft` (a device which performs a [fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)).\n\nThey're still not sure which specific path is the problem, and so they now need you to find every path from `svr` (the server rack) to `out`. However, the paths you find must all also visit both `dac` **and** `fft` (in any order).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nsvr: aaa bbb\naaa: fft\nfft: ccc\nbbb: tty\ntty: ccc\nccc: ddd eee\nddd: hub\nhub: fff\neee: dac\ndac: fff\nfff: ggg hhh\nggg: out\nhhh: out\n```\n\nThis new list of devices contains many paths from `svr` to `out`:\n\n<pre>\nsvr,aaa,<b>fft</b>,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,aaa,<b>fft</b>,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,aaa,<b>fft</b>,ccc,eee,<b>dac</b>,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,aaa,<b>fft</b>,ccc,eee,<b>dac</b>,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,<b>dac</b>,fff,ggg,out\nsvr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,<b>dac</b>,fff,hhh,out\n</pre>\n\nHowever, only **`2`** paths from `svr` to `out` visit both `dac` and `fft`.\n\nFind all of the paths that lead from `svr` to `out`. **How many of those paths visit both `dac` and `fft`?**";export{e as default};
