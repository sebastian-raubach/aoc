const e="Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.\n\nA **nice string** is one with all of the following properties:\n\n- It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.\n- It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`), or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).\n- It does not contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`), a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.\n- `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.\n- `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.\n- `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string xy.\n- `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.\n\nHow many strings are nice?\n\n[comment]: <> (PART 2)\n\nRealizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.\n\nNow, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:\n\n- It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like `xyxy` (`xy`) or `aabcdefgaa` (`aa`), but not like `aaa` (`aa`, but it overlaps).\n- It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like `xyx`, `abcdefeghi` (`efe`), or even `aaa`.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb` is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (`qj`) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (`zxz`).\n- `xxyxx` is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.\n- `uurcxstgmygtbstg` is naughty because it has a pair (`tg`) but no repeat with a single letter between them.\n- `ieodomkazucvgmuy` is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (`odo`), but no pair that appears twice.\n\nHow many strings are nice under these new rules?";export{e as default};
