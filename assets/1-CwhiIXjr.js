const e="Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's \"snow\" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect **fifty stars** by December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!\n\nHere's an easy puzzle to warm you up.\n\nSanta is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.\n\nAn opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.\n\nThe apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `(())` and `()()` both result in floor `0`.\n- `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor `3`.\n- `))(((((` also results in floor `3`.\n- `())` and `))(` both result in floor `-1` (the first basement level).\n- `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor `-3`.\n\nTo **what floor** do the instructions take Santa?\n\n[comment]: <> (PART 2)\n\nNow, given the same instructions, find the **position** of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor `-1`). The first character in the instructions has position `1`, the second character has position `2`, and so on.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `)` causes him to enter the basement at character position `1`.\n- `()())` causes him to enter the basement at character position `5`.\n\nWhat is the **position** of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?";export{e as default};
